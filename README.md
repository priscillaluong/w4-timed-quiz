# w4-timed-quiz

Week Four Challenge of the *UOB Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp* requires students to use Web APIs to create a **timed multiple-choice quiz**. 

We were given a User Story and an Acceptance Criteria as per below:

Acceptance Criteria:

## How I approached the task:

* I started by building the static elements of the quiz within HTML and CSS, ensuring that the code follows a semantic structure. 

* Once the above was satisfied, I used DOM selectors to target certain elements within *index.html*.

* Methods such as **setInterval()** (to call a function to be executed every 1000 milliseconds, in this case, the timer countdown), **addEventListener()**, **setAttribute()**, **localstorage.getItem()**, **.setItem()** etc. were used to create a dynamic quiz that displays different content and has user interaction. 


Code snippet:

```
function saveHighscore() {

  // if submit button clicked, save score 
  submitBtn.addEventListener("click", function() {
  event.preventDefault();

  var savedScores = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("highscores")) || [];
  var presentScore = {
    score: timeLeft,
    name: highscoreName.value,
  };
  savedScores.push(presentScore);
  localStorage.setItem("highscores", JSON.stringify(savedScores));
});
}
```

## Screenshot of Application Interaction:

When the user answers a question incorrectly, 8 seconds is minused from the time left.

The users highscore is the time left remaining on the clock after all questions has been answered.

Users are also alerted if they try to submit a score when the name input box is left blank.

### Final note:

*Any feedback to improve code or areas where I could further implement best practice would be greatly appreciated* ðŸ˜Š
